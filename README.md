The Big Ping
============

A simple PHP script that pings several domains and displays their IP addresses.


Usage
=====

In this early stage supply a .txt file and list all domains you'd like to ping. Each domain goes on a new line. Make sure there's an empty line at the bottom, just like in sample-sites.txt

Then uplaod all files into one directory, call it in a browser and voila.


Roadmap
=======

Right now The Big Ping is a standalone script. I'm hatching plans to create a WordPress Plugin with admin interface to add additional domains.
